pusherclient
=============

pusherclient is a python module for handling pusher websockets

Installation
------------

Simply run "python setup.py install".

This module depends on websocket-client-py3 module available from: <http://github.com/liris/websocket-client/tree/py3>

Example
-------

Example of using this pusher client to consume websockets::

    import pusherclient

    global pusher

    def connect_handler(data):
        channel = pusher.subscribe('mychannel')
        channel.bind('myevent', callback)

    pusher = pusherclient.Pusher(appkey)
    pusher.connection.bind('pusher:connection_established', connect_handler)
    pusher.connect()

    while True:
        time.sleep(1)

Sending pusher events to a channel can be done simply using the pusher client supplied by pusher.  You can get it here: <http://github.com/newbamboo/pusher_client_python>

    import pusher
    pusher.app_id = app_id
    pusher.key = appkey

    p = pusher.Pusher()
    p['mychannel'].trigger('myevent', 'mydata')

Thanks
------

Built using the websocket-client module from <http://github.com/liris/websocket-client>.
The ruby gem by Logan Koester which provides a similar service was also very helpful for a reference.  Take a look at it here: <http://github.com/logankoester/pusher-client>.
